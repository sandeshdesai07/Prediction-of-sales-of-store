# Prediction of Sales of a Store

## Overview

In today's competitive market, understanding sales patterns and predicting future performance is crucial for businesses. This project aims to analyze historical sales data of a Superstore Giant and build a regression model to predict future sales. By identifying key factors influencing sales, such as products, regions, categories, and customer segments, this project provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Key Features

* **Sales Prediction:** Develop and evaluate various regression models to accurately predict future sales figures.
* **Top Performing Products:** Identify the products that contribute the most to overall sales.
* **Regional Demand Analysis:** Determine which regions exhibit the highest demand for the store's products.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Provide actionable insights into which products, regions, categories, and customer segments the Superstore should focus on or potentially avoid.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis and model building.
* **Google Colab:** The development environment used for this project.
* **Libraries:**
    * **scikit-learn (sklearn):** For implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
    * **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
    * **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
    * **Matplotlib:** For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
    * **Seaborn:** For making statistical graphics in Python.
    * **PrettyTable:** For displaying tabular data in a visually appealing format.
    * **statsmodels:** For statistical models, including regression analysis.
